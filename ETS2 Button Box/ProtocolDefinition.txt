Commands:
Magic Number	Data Structure				Direciton				Command
42				CR terminated string		Host to Device to Host	Handshake
1				Length, LED index, RGB		Host to Device			LED states
2				Single integer 0-255		Host to Device			Global brightness
3				Length, BTN index, State	Device to Host			Button states
9				CR terminated string		Device to Host			Debug message

Handshake:

Initial Handshake, can be sent any time between commands:

1.	Host sends magic number 42
2.	Host sends string "HANDSHAKE\n"
3.	Device sends magic number 42
4.	Device sends string "HANDSHAKE: ?.?\n"
	?.? will be the version of the device code, for example "2.7".
	Version will be used for compatibility ensurance and upgrade requests

LED states:

1.	Host sends magic number 1
2.	Host sends integer 'length' of LEDs
	Full data length = 'length' * 4 (index, red, green, blue)
3.	Host sends, for each LED, for a total of 'length':
	3.1	Integer LED index
	3.2	Integer Red Value (0-255)
	3.3	Integer Green Value (0-255)
	3.4	Integer Blue Value (0-255)

Global brightness:

1.	Host sends send magic number 2
2.	Host sends integer brightness value (0-255)

Button states:

1.	Device sends magic number 3
2.	Device sends integer 'length' of buttons
	Full data length = 'length' * 2
3.	Device sends, for each button, for a total of 'lenght':
	3.1	Integer button index
	3.2	Integer value of button state (0 = Off, 1 = On)

Debug message:
1.	Device sends magic number 9
2.	Device sends CR terminated string (eg. "Test\n")
